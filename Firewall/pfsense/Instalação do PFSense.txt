Booting from USB

    If the boot stops with a mountroot error while booting off the installation disc, usually with USB CD/DVD drives, escape to the loader prompt and run the following: 

 set kern.cam.boot_delay="10000"
 boot

    On 2.0 this is on the boot menu - option #3 to boot from USB devices.

At which point the boot will continue normally and a normal installation will be possible.

If running permanently from a medium that requires this delay, edit /boot/loader.conf.local and insert the following line:

kern.cam.boot_delay="10000"

    If booting fails from a USB 3.0 port and the above does not help, try a USB 2.0 port with the same delay settings.
