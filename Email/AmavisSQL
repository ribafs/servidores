Summary

Amavisd has two settings to use its SQL tables:

    @storage_sql_dsn uses 4 sql tables (msgs, msgrcpt, maddr, quarantine), and it's used to store:
        basic info of inbound and outbound message. e.g. mail subject, sender address, recipient address, timestamp, etc. Note: no mail body.
        quarantined mails. Note: it stores full message of quarantined mail, including mail body.

    @lookup_sql_dsn: uses 4 sql tables (mailaddr, policy, users, wblist), and it's used to store:
        per-account spam policy
        per-account white/blacklists

    Note: iRedMail has addition sql table outbound_wblist to store white/blacklists for outbound emails, but it's used by iRedAPD (plugin amavisd_wblist), not by Amavisd.

@lookup_sql_dsn

    Table amavisd.mailaddr stores email addresses NOT hosted on your server.

    Note: value of column mailaddr.email could be something like below:
        @.: a catch-all address.
        @domain.com: entire domain.
        @.domain.com: entire domain and all its sub-domains.
        user@domain.com: a single email address.
        user@*: email addresses start with user@. Note: This is used by iRedAPD, not Amavisd.
        192.168.1.2: a single IP address. Note: This is used by iRedAPD, not Amavisd.
        192.168.*.2: wildcard IP address. Note: This is used by iRedAPD, not Amavisd.

    The addresses are used in several tables:
        amavisd.wblist: used by Amavisd. If sender (of inbound message) is blacklisted, Amavisd will quarantine this email. But if you have iRedAPD plugin amavisd_wblist enabled, this smtp session will be rejected before queued by Postfix, so Amavisd doesn't know this rejected message at all.
        amavisd.outbound_wblist. New in iRedMail-0.9.3, used by iRedAPD plugin amavisd_wblist for white/blacklisting for outbound message.

    amavisd.users stores mail addresses hosted on your server. NOTE: you don't need to sync all existing mail users in this table, just add mail users you want to define a per-account spam policy in this table.

    Value of column users.email uses same format as amavisd.mailaddr mentioned above.

    amavisd.wblist stores white/blacklists for inbound message. wblist.sid (sender id) refers to mailaddr.id, wblist.rid (recipient id) refers to users.id.

    amavisd.outbound_wblist stores white/blacklists for outbound message. outbound_wblist.sid (sender id) refers to users.id, outbound_wblist.rid (recipient id) refers to mailaddr.id.

    Note: this table is used by iRedAPD, not Amavisd.

    amavisd.policy: used to define per-recipient spam policy, and max message size limit.

    msgs
    msgrcpt
    quarantine

Since Amavisd will store basic info of every inbound/outbound email, the SQL database will grow bigger and bigger, iRedMail setups a daily cron job to clean up old records with script shipped in iRedAdmin (available in both iRedAdmin open source edition and iRedAdmin-Pro): tools/cleanup_amavisd_db.py.
