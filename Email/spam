Move detected spam to Junk folder

To move detected spam to user's Junk folder, you need to enable global sieve script in Dovecot.

You can find sample sieve rule file /var/vmail/sieve/dovecot.sieve.sample if you chose /var/vmail to store mailboxes during iRedMail installation. If you have a custom mailbox storage directory, the sample sieve rule file should be sieve/dovecot.sieve.sample under that directory. If you cannot find it, you can still download one from iRedMail project: here.

This file must be owned by user vmail and group vmail, permission 0500.

Now open Dovecot config file /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf (on Linux/OpenBSD) or /usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf (FreeBSD), make sure you have setting like below:

# Part of file: /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf

plugin {
    ...
    sieve_before = /var/vmail/sieve/dovecot.sieve
    ...
}

Restart Dovecot service to enable it.

Note: we don't use sieve_default = for global sieve script, because it will be ignored if users have their own personal sieve rule files.

iRedAdmin-Pro: Priority of spam policy used in iRedMail & iRedAdmin-Pro

With @lookup_sql_dsn = enabled in Amavisd config file, Amavisd will lookup spam policies from SQL database amavisd for different accounts. The priorities of different spam policies are:

    Highest: per-user spam policy set in user profile page
    Lower: per-domain spam policy set in domain profile page
    Even lower: global spam policy set in iRedAdmin-Pro: "System -> Anti Spam -> Global Spam Policy"
    Lowest: server wide spam policy defined in Amavisd config file.

 Improve Spam Filtering?

As you can see, a valid SPF DNS setting decrease the spam score:

    SPF_PASS=-10

You can try to remove SPF related score setting in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf by commenting out below line:

score SPF_PASS -10.000

Restarting Amavisd service is required.

Thanks for this suggestion!  This single change has cut down the spam load by around 70%.  That's great! 

Now I'd like to see what else I can do to improve the performance of spamassassin.  What is the best way to set up spamassassin to train it on spam vs ham in an iredmail install?
